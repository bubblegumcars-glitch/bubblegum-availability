## What Changed:

### 1. **New Section: ⚡ Quick Turnaround Needed** (Top Priority)
- Shows cars that are being returned and rented again within 30 minutes
- **Red badge** (most urgent)
- Sorted by gap time (smallest gap first)
- Shows "X min gap" label
- Example: "Blossom returns 11:30, next rental 11:45" → 15 min gap

### 2. **Priority Section - Now Sorted by Next Rental Time**
- Cars returned after 6pm last night
- **Sorted by next rental time** (earliest rental times at top)

## Logic Details:

**Quick Turnaround Detection:**
```javascript
returnTime = 11:30
nextRental = 11:45
gap = 15 minutes
→ Shows in Quick Turnaround section (gap ≤ 30 min)
```

**Priority Sorting:**
```javascript
Car A: Next rental 09:15
Car B: Next rental 10:30
Car C: Next rental 14:00

Display order:
1. Car A (09:15) ← Highest priority
2. Car B (10:30)
3. Car C (14:00)
```

- These will appear in the red "Quick Turnaround Needed" section

To see Priority sorting:
- Cars with 9:00am rentals will be at the top
- Cars with later rentals (11am, 2pm) will be below
